# Wake-up-light

[Overview image to add here]

The Wake-up light is a 2-in-1 alarm clock and reading light. 20 minutes before the alarm goes off, LED bars will slowly start to light up, being fully lit and sounding a calming alarm sound when the time to wake is reached. Furthermore, by turning a knob the LED bars also light up and can be used as a reading light. For the last 10 minutes the LEDs will slowly dim and gently help the user to sleep.
