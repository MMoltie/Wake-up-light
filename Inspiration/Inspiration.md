# The original inspiration

This project started from my Grundig Wake Up Light. It's cheap, and just exactly not working. Mainly due to two reasons:
* You can only set the reading light for increments of 15 minutes. Meaning when you're reading a book and juuust want to finish the last paragraph in the last remaining light, but are too slow, you can only start a full 15 minute reading session. Vice versa, if you choose a 30 minute reading cycle, you cannot easily turn it off when you notice you're already tired and just want to go to sleep.
* There are two sets of buttons: seven push buttons on the top and five capacitive buttons on the front. From the front you cannot see which button on the top is for which action, meaning you need a light and turn the clock to see which is which. And when pressing one of the buttons on the front the clock will tip over.

Also, all of the available, supposedly calming, alarm sounds just sound like five types of static with a hint of meadow, seabreeze or forest. 

# Generative AI
I asked Midjourney and Dall-E for a redesign, that came up with the following examples:

# Design sketches
From the AI inspiration I knew I wanted something with a round display and LED bars radiating out or be on the side somewhere. Since im an Industrial Designer by trade I sketched my own designs:

Finally settling for something along the lines of this:
